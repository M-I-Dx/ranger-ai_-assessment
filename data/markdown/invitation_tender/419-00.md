OVERVIEW
1\.1 Purpose
This Transfer Station Operations Plan (the Plan) outlines the operation of the Invermere Transfer
Station. The Plan is part of the waste management implementation process and should be
reviewed as a tool for the overall management and operation of the facility.
This Plan is intended to provide details for the following items:
• Transfer Station management and • waste acceptance; and
responsibilities; • operational procedures.
• training and safety;
• regulations;
The use and implementation of the provisions within this Plan are intended to provide
compliance with all regulatory requirements. The Plan is based on compliance with BC’s
regulatory regime and on good practice for transfer stations.
1\.2 Location
The transfer station is located on Industrial 1 Rd in Athalmer, adjacent to the District’s Public
Works yard, in an industrial area within the District of Invermere.
1\.3 Design Concept
The Transfer Station is designed to accept all the waste from residents in the District of
Invermere and its surrounding rural area.
Large bulk loads and wastes that are not accepted at the transfer station are to go directly to the
Columbia Valley Landfill. Examples of these loads includes but is not limited to: loads of
demolition waste, wood waste, rubble, car hulks and clean fill.
The site consists of an operator’s shelter at the entrance. There are staging areas for materials
that can be recycled, diverted, or require special handling:
• Recycle BC recyclables
• Household MSW
The transfer station primarily collects municipal solid waste which is then hauled to the Columbia
Valley Landfill in Windermere.
1\.4 Access
The Transfer Station is fenced entirely around its perimeter with a lockable gate at the entrance
to prevent unauthorized access to the site and provide public protection. Signs are posted that
clearly identify the hours of operation, the wastes that can be received, and emergency contact
telephone numbers. The Transfer Station is staffed whenever the gates are open, and the
Transfer Station is in operation.

5\.1 Waste Control
Allow only acceptable waste materials for transfer at the facility. These are defined as municipal
solid waste (MSW) by the “Waste Management Act", which refers to refuse which originates
from residential, commercial, institutional, demolition, land clearing or construction sources.
Typical acceptable wastes at the Invermere Transfer Station are:
• residential (food scraps, packaging, diapers, unused items, etc.);
Large loads of residential, commercial, institutional, demolition, land clearing or construction
wastes will be sent directly to the Columbia Valley Landfill. Large loads are defined as deliveries
in vehicles with a volume larger than a pick\-up truck. The scale attendant may at their discretion
direct large volume deliveries from residential sources to the landfill given available capacity at
the Transfer Station.
Screen all wastes at the Transfer Station gate and site. Reject any unacceptable materials. The
waste screening process involves the following components;
• observation and inquiry of waste streams for every load at the Transfer Station gate;
• random load inspections on the site;
• documentation and record keeping; and
• education and enforcement.
Train all staff in waste acceptance procedures, such that they will be able to identify potentially
unacceptable materials. Examples of unacceptable materials are special wastes, bulk liquids,

OPERATIONS PLAN – INVERMERE TRANSFER STATION Page 8
biomedical wastes, and large metallic objects. For information regarding the acceptability of
wastes for disposal, contact the MOE.
Advise users of the facility through signs of the materials that are acceptable and those that are
unacceptable.
Some indicators of potentially unacceptable wastes are:
• warning labels on containers; • pressure vessels;
• leaking loads or liquids; • intact drums;
• oily wastes; • loads with unusual documentation;
• powders; and
• sealed containers; • loads with noxious odours.
• tanks;
Residential waste haulers arriving at the site with unacceptable wastes shall be denied access.
They could also contact the MOE for the location of the nearest appropriate facility.
Keep the site tidy by conducting regular litter pick\-ups, maintenance of landscaping and
maintaining good operational practices.
5\.2 Waste Acceptance And Storage
Objectives
• accept waste for transfer;
• direct and store recyclable materials in appropriate areas; and
• identify and remove unacceptable materials.
Procedures
Direct users of the facility to the appropriate locations of the Transfer Station by confirming
nature of load at the entrance to the facility.
Clearly mark all containers or storage areas for recyclable materials as to their contents. Advise
users how to place wastes into the areas.
Provide unobstructed access to the recycling bins or storage areas for both users and transfer
vehicles to allow ease of disposing materials and collecting bins once they are full. Maintain
setback distances from property lines and other facilities.
Regularly remove unacceptable wastes and or segregation areas.
5\.3 Waste Drop\-Off And Transfer
Objectives
• place waste and recyclables in designated areas or bins;

bins.
Remove waste from the facility as quickly as possible to prevent accumulation and reduce
odours.
Remove all accumulated waste from the site daily. Only in emergency situations, should waste
be allowed to accumulate and must be previously approved by the RDEK. Once the emergency
has passed, remove all accumulated waste from the Transfer Station as quickly as possible.
Cover all loads of waste prior to leaving the Transfer Station to prevent the possibility of wind
blown litter at the site and during the transfer to the landfill.
Maintain records of the number of trips and loads leaving the facility on a daily basis.
Direct all loads of waste to proceed to their final destination immediately.
6\.0 RECYCLABLE AND DIVERTIBLE MATERIALS MANAGEMENT
The Transfer Station maintains a staging area for recyclable/divertible materials and materials
requiring special handling that are brought by the general public. This section lists special
handling requirements for these materials.
Recyclable materials are not expected to create any leachate. Materials requiring special
handling, such as lead acid batteries, may be stored on special containment pads.
