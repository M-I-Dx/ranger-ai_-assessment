4\.0 BACKGROUND
Constructed in 1971, Fire Hall 1 is a two storey plus basement facility
consisting primarily of concrete/wood frame construction and minor steel
elements. Main components of the building include the apparatus bay, hose
tower, garage, dormitory, and office spaces. The Hall is the only fire station
within the City of North Vancouver.
The Fire Hall operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, year round. It
serves as a workplace and dwelling for the first responders.
Throughout the years, the building has gone through extensive maintenance
and repairs as well as some major renovations, the latest renovation being a
structural upgrade in 2017\. The current dormitory has not been updated. It is
based in the original design concept, with an open room housing beds and
lockers.
The Fire Hall now staffs more first responders than what the original design
allows for, leading to the need for more beds and space.
To address the increased number of staff and the need to update the sleeping
quarters to meet current day standards, the existing dormitory will be
renovated and converted into 11 individual bedrooms, along with renewal of
the adjacent activity room.

The Corporation of the City of North Vancouver
Invitation to Tender \- Fire Hall 1 Dormitory Renovations
Detailed design and construction documents have been prepared by the
project Prime Consultant “KMBR Architects Planners Inc.” and their
engineering sub\-consultant team. The building permit has been submitted
and is being reviewed by the City. It is anticipated that it will be issued by the
end of September.
5\.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
In order to update the sleeping quarters to meet the current day standards,
the City of North Vancouver will be renovating the existing dormitory and
convert it into 11 individual bedrooms. The successful proponent will
undertake the renovations necessary to the dormitory to meet the current
needs of the Fire Hall.
The City is seeking a construction team that is experienced in performing
renovations of occupied institutional buildings. While the renovation work is in
progress, firefighters will be relocated to a different building area.
The existing dormitory is on the second floor and consists of a large open
room with high ceilings. The perimeter of the room is lined with built in,
millwork lockers. There are also half\-walls providing some privacy in select
areas.
In conjunction with the renovation, the existing mechanical system is to be
replaced with a new system that is dedicated to serve the renovated areas.
Contractors will not have access through the building during the renovation
as to not impede building operations. Access to the construction area will be
created from the rear apron on the south side of the building onto the second
floor balcony and through the sliding door. This area is to be reverted into the
original condition once the construction work is completed.
General Overview:
 Temporary construction hoarding and scaffolding
 Abatement and selective demolition
 Construction of interior walls and fire separations
 Removal and replacement of mechanical system
 Roofing work
 Electrical and lighting upgrades
 Data cabling and PA speakers
 Associated structural upgrades
The above is a general overview of the work. Proponents should review the
above in conjunction with the Tender package, specifications, and drawings
for a complete understanding of the project scope.

APPENDIX C
SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT
Introduction
This Supplier Code of Conduct (SCC) is intended to augment and expand upon the core
labour conventions of the ILO as found in Appendix A of this Sustainable Buyer Policy. The
SCC sets the ethical performance expectations for suppliers of goods, services or
equipment to the City of North Vancouver.
The goal of the SCC is to ensure safe and healthy workplaces for the people who make
products (or provide services) for the City; to partner with suppliers who share the same
values for human and civil rights conditions as does the City.
Sustainability decisions are informed and guided by measures of ecology, economy and the
expectations of society. The City looks to create business relationships that recognize,
respect and help reach the goals of sustainability that are defined in our Official Community
Plan.
The policy is not intended to interfere with collective agreements. It is the supplier's
responsibility to ensure subcontractors are compliant with the SCC.
Legal and Ethical Responsibilities
City suppliers and their sub\-contractors will comply with national and other applicable laws
of the country of manufacture of products including those laws relating to labour, worker
health and safety, and the environment. Where the provisions of law and this SCC address
the same issue, the provision that is most stringent will apply.
Child Labour
City suppliers and their sub\-contractors:
 will not hire people under the age of 15, (or 14 where the International Labour
 Organization exemption for developing countries allows) unless local minimum age
law stipulates a higher age for work or mandatory schooling, in which case the
higher age would apply, as defined by the International Labour Organization.
 where local laws do not exist or where they set lower standards than the ILO, the
ILO standards shall prevail.
 where a child worker must be displaced, adult family members should have the
opportunity to assume the child’s position in order to maintain family earnings.
Forced Labour
City suppliers and their sub\-contractors shall not:
 use forced, illegal, or prison labour, including indentured or bonded labour, or any
form of compulsory labour to manufacture our products. (Excluding approved and
recognized work programs).
22

The Corporation of the City of North Vancouver
Invitation to Tender \- Fire Hall 1 Dormitory Renovations
Disciplinary Practices
City suppliers and their sub\-contractors shall:
 treat workers with respect and dignity. No employee shall be subject to any form of
physical, sexual, psychological, or verbal harassment or abuse.
 ensure workers are free to express their concerns about workplace conditions
without fear of retribution of losing their jobs. Workers should have access to a
formal avenue to express concerns directly to factory management or jurisdictional
authority.
Freedom of Association
City suppliers and their sub\-contractors will recognize and respect that workers, without
distinction, have the right to form or join trade unions of their own choosing and to bargain
collectively.
Wages and Benefits
City suppliers and their sub\-contractors recognize that wages are essential to meeting the
basic needs of employees. Employers shall:
 pay employees, as a minimum, at least the minimum wage required by local law or
the prevailing industry wages, whichever is higher, and shall provide legally
mandated benefits.
 pay workers directly and provide workers with clear, written accounting of hours
worked, deductions, and regular and overtime wages in a language they can
understand.
Hours of Work
City suppliers and their sub\-contractors shall:
 ensure that regular working hours do not exceed forty eight (48\) hours per week, and
that the combination of regular hours and required overtime hours do not exceed
sixty (60\) hours per week except in emergency circumstances.
 ensure that overtime hours are compensated either according to the law, or where
the law is silent, at premium rates for hours in excess of forty eight (48\) hours and
that hours worked in excess of sixty (60\) hours per week are on a voluntary basis.
 ensure that workers are provided at least one day off during every seven (7\) day
period.
Discrimination
City suppliers and their sub\-contractors shall:
 consider employees for positions on the basis of their qualifications and abilities. The
City will not work with suppliers who discriminate on the basis of race, gender,
23

The Corporation of the City of North Vancouver
Invitation to Tender \- Fire Hall 1 Dormitory Renovations
political or religious beliefs, social, ethnic or national origin, marital status, age, union
affiliation, sexual orientation, or disability.
 ensure pregnant workers are assigned work tasks appropriate for, and not
threatening to, their condition.
Health and Safety
City suppliers and their sub\-contractors shall:
 provide a safe and healthy working environment to prevent accidents and injury to
health arising out of, linked with, or occurring in the course of work or as a result of
the operation of employer facilities.
 provide health and safety training appropriate for their industry.
 ensure that any living facilities provided for personnel are safe and clean and meet
the basic needs of personnel.
Environmental Commitment
City suppliers and their sub\-contractors shall:
 ensure all waste materials, as a by\-product of production, are disposed of properly in
an environmentally responsible manner, and according to the local and international
laws and regulations.
 seek out leading industry practices aimed at conserving natural resources and
reducing carbon emissions.
 commit to packaging standards that reduce the amount of materials used or, have a
recycled content with a minimum of 30% postconsumer waste content.
 ensure compliance with third party, bona fide, local and international standards for
materials and ethical conduct.
Compliance and Implementation
The City expects all its suppliers to respect its SCC and to actively do their utmost to
achieve the City’s standards. The City believes in cooperation and the City is willing to work
with its suppliers to improve performance where necessary. The City may require that
suppliers provide details on factory and production facility locations of suppliers and
subcontractors and may make this information publicly available
The City reserves the right to ask for proof of compliance with all applicable labour, health,
safety, and environmental laws, and may inspect working conditions, at any time (or request
independent verification of compliance). Suppliers must maintain current and sufficiently
detailed records to substantiate their compliance with the SCC and the City may ask that
they are independently verified at the supplier’s expense.

Ref: CONTRACTOR VERSION \- PRE\-PROJECT HAZARDOUS BUILDING MATERIALS SURVEY FOR THE
PLANNED DORMITORY RENOVATION AT FIRE HALL NO.1 AT 165 EAST 13TH STREET, NORTH
VANCOUVER, BC
1\.0 INTRODUCTION
Astech Consultants Ltd. (Astech) were retained by the City of North Vancouver to conduct a Pre\-Project
Hazardous Building Materials Survey and compile a detailed report on the presence and location of
asbestos containing building materials, lead, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury, stored chemicals,
and silica to be impacted by the planned Dormitory renovation at Fire Hall No.1 located at 165 East 13th
Street, North Vancouver, BC.
Astech’s survey and report format is designed specifically to satisfy the current applicable regulation from
the Workers’ Compensation Board of British Columbia (WCB) Occupational Health and Safety Regulation
20\.112 regarding hazardous building material assessments by a Qualified Person for buildings and
structures.
This survey was conducted on June 18 and 26, 2024 by Tom Farrell assisted by Cassandra Marshall and
Sean Habkirk of Astech, and is amalgamated with information from previous surveys conducted by Astech,
Pinchin, and Kinetic OHS Services Ltd. It must be emphasized that this survey was concerned exclusively
with the subject areas of the building. As required for the planned renovation scope of work, the site
survey was destructive in nature and thorough in investigating layered floor, wall, and ceiling systems.
However, inaccessible areas which would require the actual dismantling of substantial portions of the
building in order to gain access were not investigated. No attempt was made to investigate some areas
of the building, underground services, or the surrounding property. Therefore, if during work activities,
other hazardous materials, asbestos containing materials, or potential asbestos containing materials not
included in this report are discovered, work should immediately cease in the affected area. At that time,
Astech should be contacted so that they can initiate immediate appropriate action so that there are no
undue delays.
2\.0 BUILDING DESCRIPTION
The building is described as a two\-storey plus basement fire hall building with hose tower faced with brick
and concrete. According to BC Assessment, the building was originally constructed in 1971\. The
building has had several renovations over the years. The building is heated by a natural gas boiler and air
handling unit, and rooftop natural gas HVAC units and ductwork. The subject of this report is specific
areas of the building to be impacted by the planned Dormitory Renovation Project. At the time of survey,
the subject areas were in good condition, except as noted in concealed wall cavities and ceiling spaces.

3\.0 METHODOLOGY
3\.1 ASBESTOS CONTAINING MATERIALS
A visual inspection was undertaken in order to determine the type, location, and homogeneous nature of
asbestos and potential asbestos containing building materials located at the subject areas. During this
inspection, seventy\-one (71\) bulk samples of potential asbestos containing materials were collected from
specific locations of the building, however, two (2\) bulk samples did not require analysis. The number of
samples collected during this survey are in accordance with the guidelines established by the WCB in their
2023 publication Safe Work Practices for Handling Asbestos, and as indicated by actual site conditions.
The samples collected were submitted for analysis at our in\-house laboratory in accordance with the WCB
Occupational Health and Safety Regulation, utilizing polarized light microscopy, and dispersion staining
techniques. Results of laboratory analysis of the samples collected during this survey and relevant samples
previously collected are attached.
3\.2 LEAD FINISHES
A visual inspection was undertaken in order to determine the type and location of paints, primers, coatings,
and/or glazing finishes suspected of containing lead at the subject areas. During this inspection, nine (9\)
potential lead finishes were collected/analyzed from specific locations of the building. The finishes were
collected/analyzed in accordance with US EPA methods and the requirements of the WCB Occupational
Health and Safety Regulation. Results of the finishes collected/analyzed during this survey and relevant
samples previously collected are attached.
3\.3 LEAD CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, PCBs, MERCURY, STORED CHEMICALS, AND SILICA
A visual inspection was undertaken at the subject areas in order to determine the presence of:
\- construction materials suspected of containing lead and other heavy metals,
\- fluorescent and high intensity discharge (HID) light fixtures suspected of containing PCB ballasts
or capacitors,
\- thermostats, light tubes/bulbs, and associated equipment suspected of containing mercury,
\- stored chemicals suspected of being toxic, flammable, or explosive, and
\- building materials suspected of containing silica in crystalline and non\-crystalline forms.
4\.0 INSPECTION RESULTS
4\.1 ASBESTOS CONTAINING MATERIALS
GENERAL NOTES
\#1 Filling Compound and Affected Gypsum Board: Although the analytical results for some of the
gypsum board filling compound samples indicate non\-asbestos results because of renovations
conducted in the 1980s or later, site investigation and laboratory analysis of other representative
samples have determined that as listed below, there is asbestos containing filling compound on
older gypsum board (installed between approximately 1964 and 1979\), or there is newer gypsum
board with non\-asbestos filling compound fastened directly to or abutting the older gypsum board
with asbestos containing filling compound (some double layered and some concealed behind
wood and other building materials).
Page 2 of 12

Astech Consultants Ltd. Ref: 27475HE01C.AEH
As well, some of the asbestos containing filling compound and contaminated gypsum board are
concealed behind and/or abutting wood, wood studs, ceramic tiles, grouts, adhesives, cove base,
texture coats, acoustic ceiling panels, 2' x 2' ceiling tiles, and other building materials, and are
contaminated with the asbestos containing filling compound. There is also asbestos containing
filling compound and/or asbestos containing filling compound residue on and within electrical
junction boxes and other building materials where finished gypsum board is located.
The removal of flooring materials, cupboards, shelving, mouldings, millwork, and other items
fastened to asbestos containing building materials on floors, walls, and ceilings must be removed
by the qualified Abatement Contractor following “Moderate Risk” asbestos work procedures and
once decontaminated, may either be disposed of, salvaged, or retained for future use.
Additionally, there is asbestos containing filling compound residue and debris located on floors
(concealed beneath layers of carpet, ceramic tiles, asbestos containing flooring adhesive residue,
asbestos containing floor tiles, asbestos containing floor tile adhesive, asbestos containing floor
levelling compound, potential asbestos containing ceramic floor tile grout and mortar, non\-
asbestos carpet adhesive, and other flooring materials, cellulose board, construction paper, wood,
mouldings, plumbing fixtures, millwork, and/or other building materials) where asbestos
containing filling compound on gypsum board is located, resulting in asbestos contaminated
carpet, ceramic tiles, adhesives, and other building materials on all finished floors where asbestos
containing filling compound on gypsum board is located.
\#2 Spray Applied Texture Coat: As listed below, there is asbestos containing spray applied texture
coat on gypsum board ceilings with asbestos containing filling compound (some concealed).
There is also asbestos containing spray applied texture coat overspray on and within electrical
junction boxes and other building materials where asbestos containing spray applied texture coat
is located.
Additionally, there is asbestos containing spray applied texture coat residues and debris located
on floors (concealed beneath layers of carpet, ceramic floor tiles, asbestos containing flooring
adhesive residue, asbestos containing floor tiles, asbestos containing floor tile adhesive, asbestos
containing floor levelling compound, potential asbestos containing ceramic floor tile grout and
mortar, non\-asbestos carpet adhesive, and other flooring materials, cellulose board, construction
paper, wood, mouldings, plumbing fixtures, millwork, and/or other building materials) where
asbestos containing spray applied texture coat is located, resulting in asbestos contaminated
carpet, sheet floorings, adhesives, and other building materials on all finished floors where spray
applied texture coat is located.
\#3 Potential Asbestos Containing Building Materials: The potential asbestos containing building
materials listed below, must be considered as asbestos containing until laboratory results
determine otherwise. These materials were either inaccessible at time of survey and/or not likely
to be impacted by project. In order to sample the materials destructive testing may be required.

5\.0 RECOMMENDATIONS
5\.1 ASBESTOS CONTAINING MATERIALS
Prior to the renovation or demolition of a building or it’s components, the asbestos (or potential asbestos)
containing materials that are directly impacted by the work or are damaged and require remedial action
must first be either enclosed or encapsulated, or removed and disposed of by a qualified hazardous
materials abatement contractor’s trained and authorized personnel. If repaired (enclosed or encapsulated)
prior to renovations, the asbestos containing materials may be left in place in an undisturbed stable
condition.
Asbestos and potential asbestos containing materials not impacted by renovation work and not requiring
remedial action may remain in place as long as they are in a stable condition (not damaged) in which they
would be considered to be safely enclosed or encapsulated. Workers must be advised in writing of their
presence and location so that the asbestos and potential asbestos containing materials are not
inadvertently disturbed. Removing, enclosing, encapsulating, or otherwise disturbing (e.g. drilling,
abrading, etc.) asbestos or potential asbestos containing materials must be performed by a qualified
contractor’s trained personnel in accordance with the WCB Occupational Health and Safety Regulation.
Disposal of asbestos containing materials must be performed in accordance with the BC Ministry of
Environment and Climate Change Strategy \- Environmental Management Act \- Hazardous Waste
Regulation.
Page 8 of 12

Astech Consultants Ltd. Ref: 27475HE01C.AEH
5\.2 LEAD
Paints/Primers
Where lead (or potential lead) based paints and/or primers are affected by a project, the work must be
performed by a qualified contractor in accordance with the WCB Occupational Health and Safety
Regulation and their 2020 publication entitled Safe Work Practices For Handling Lead.
Where the base substrate material is to be removed in conjunction with lead paint removal, the base
substrate and lead based paints and/or primers should be removed intact by the contractor, in accordance
with the contractor’s risk assessment and site specific work procedures. The workers conducting the
work and workers in close proximity to the work being performed, should be protected with personal
protective equipment as determined by the contractor’s risk assessment and site specific work procedures.
Lead containing paints which remain attached to metal building materials may be transported as normal
construction waste to a metal recycling facility. Lead containing paints which remain attached to
concrete, wood, and/or other non\-metal building materials must be labelled as lead based paints (LBP) for
transporting to a licensed/approved disposal site or recycling facility. A licensed/approved facility receiving
the waste must be informed of the lead content of these materials and be agreeable to receiving these
materials. Prior to acceptance of waste with lead paints at a licensed/approved disposal facility, the
contractor generating the waste must ensure that all waste materials containing LBP’s are sampled intact,
fastened directly to the base substrate, and representative of the waste stream created by demolition. The
contractor shall have the representative sample analyzed utilizing a Toxicity Characteristic Leachate
Procedure for lead (TCLP lead) test to determine the potential for soil and/or groundwater contamination,
if deemed necessary by the site receiving the waste.
If the lead paints are to be separated or removed from the building materials by means of sanding,
scraping, abrading, blasting, welding/torch cutting, etc., more stringent work procedures would apply. The
removed lead paints, depending on lead concentrations and leachate results, may become a Hazardous
Waste and therefore must be disposed of in accordance with the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate
Change Strategy \- Environmental Management Act \- Hazardous Waste Regulation.
Glazing Finishes
Where ceramic tiles with lead (or potential lead) glazing finishes are to be removed, the ceramic tile and
glazing finish should be removed intact. The workers conducting the work and workers in close proximity
to the work being performed, should be protected with personal protective equipment as determined by
the removal contractor’s risk assessment and site specific work procedures. Ceramic tiles and glazing
finishes that are removed intact may be disposed of as normal construction waste.
If the lead glazing finishes are to be separated or removed from the ceramic tiles by means of sanding,
scraping, abrading, blasting, etc., more stringent work procedures by a qualified abatement contractor
would apply in order to satisfy the WCB Occupational Health and Safety Regulation and their 2020
publication entitled Safe Work Practices For Handling Lead.
Lead Construction Materials
Where affected by a renovation project, the lead roof jacks must first be removed, and be recycled or
disposed of, in accordance with the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy \-
Environmental Management Act \- Hazardous Waste Regulation.
5\.3 PCB CONTAINING BALLASTS
It is recommended that the identification of affected PCB ballasts be performed by qualified personnel prior
to or in conjunction with the renovation of a building, at a time when it becomes feasible to isolate
Page 9 of 12

Astech Consultants Ltd. Ref: 27475HE01C.AEH
electrical power and disassemble/disconnect the light fixtures. The ballasts that are identified as PCB
containing must be removed in accordance with the WCB Occupational Health and Safety Regulation and
disposed of in accordance with the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy \-
Environmental Management Act \- Hazardous Waste Regulation.
5\.4 MERCURY
Where affected by a renovation project, the mercury containing light tubes/bulbs must first be removed,
and be salvaged, recycled or disposed of, in accordance with the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate
Change Strategy \- Environmental Management Act \- Hazardous Waste Regulation.
5\.5 STORED CHEMICALS AND OTHER HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Stored Chemicals
Where affected by a renovation project, stored chemicals, ozone depleting substances within refrigeration
equipment, and radioactive equipment must first be removed, and be recycled or disposed of, in
accordance with the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy \- Environmental
Management Act \- Hazardous Waste Regulation.
Rodent Droppings
Rodent droppings which can cause infectious disease and/or respiratory disease in humans should be
removed as biohazardous waste by a qualified abatement contractor in accordance with the WCB
Occupational Health and Safety Regulation, prior to unprotected trades performing work in or conducting
selective demolition of a building. In lieu of removing droppings, workers shall wear respirators and
protective clothing while in contaminated areas of a building, and while conducting selective demolition
of a building.
Natural Gas
The natural gas must be shut off and purged by Fortis BC or a qualified trades person prior to work that
would affect the gas, and prior to building renovation.
5\.6 SILICA
Where cementitious building materials that are suspected of containing silica in crystalline form are directly
impacted by the project (i.e. drilling, cutting, abrading, etc.), the work should be performed in a controlled
manner to avoid the release of crystalline silica dust. Cutting, drilling, or otherwise disturbing these
building materials must be performed by a qualified contractor’s trained personnel in accordance with the
WCB Occupational Health and Safety Regulation.
6\.0 OWNER'S AND ABATEMENT CONTRACTOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES

City of North Vancouver Page 8 of 11
Condition Description
DSD\-0 Sound Surface (may include visual (aesthetic) defects that do not affect
films protective properties).
DSD\-1 Slightly Deteriorated Surface (may show fading; gloss reduction, slight
surface contamination, minor pin holes scratches, etc.) / Minor cosmetic
defects (runs, sags, etc.).
DSD\-2 Moderately Deteriorated Surface (small areas of peeling, flaking, slight
cracking, staining, etc.).
DSD\-3 Severely Deteriorated Surface (heavy peeling, flaking, cracking,
checking, scratches, scuffs, abrasion, small holes and gouges).
DSD\-4 Substrate Damage (repair or replacement of surface required by others).
.3 No repainting work shall commence until all such DSD\-4 adverse conditions and defects have been
corrected and surfaces and conditions are acceptable to the Painting Contractor. The Painting
Contractor shall not be responsible for the condition of the substrate or for correcting defects and
deficiencies in the substrate, which may adversely affect the painting work except for minimal work
normally performed by the Painting Contractor and as, indicated herein. It shall always, however, be
the responsibility of the Painting Contractor to see that surfaces are properly prepared before any
paint or coating is applied.
.4 It shall also be the Painting Contractor’s responsibility to paint the surface as specified providing that
the Owner accepts responsibility for uncorrected DSD\-4 substrate conditions.
3\.2 Preparation of Surfaces:
.1 Prepare all interior surfaces for repainting in accordance with MPI Repainting Manual requirements.
Refer to the MPI Repainting Manual in regard to specific requirements for the following:
.2 Wash all surfaces requiring paint application prior to sanding and filling with an appropriate cleaning
agent, such as TSP. All surfaces specified for coatings require full sanding to de\-gloss the surface.
.3 Metal surfaces are to be cleaned using Hi\-Lite Solutions Aero Green 4110 Paint Prep Cleaner.

plates, mechanical louvers, door and window hardware (e.g. hinges, knobs, locks, trim, frame stops),
removable rating / hazard / instruction labels, washroom accessories, light fixture trim, etc. from wall and
ceiling surfaces, doors and frames, prior to repainting and replace upon completion. Carefully clean and
replace all such items upon completion of repainting work in each area. Do not use solvent or reactive
cleaning agents on items that will mar or remove finishes (e.g. lacquer finishes). Doors shall be removed
before repainting to paint bottom and top edges and then re\-hung.
.5 Protect all adjacent interior surfaces and areas, including rating and instruction labels on doors, frames,
equipment, piping, etc., from repainting operations and damage by drop cloths, shields, masking,
templates, or other suitable protective means and make good any damage caused by failure to provide
such protection.
