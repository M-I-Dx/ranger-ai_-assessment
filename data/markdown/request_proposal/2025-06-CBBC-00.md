to Proceed”). As of the Effective Date, Contractor will begin the Work, provided that
no Construction will be performed on a Segment prior to the issuance the Notice to
Proceed for the applicable Segment. CBBC expects to issue a single Notice to
Proceed for all Segments but reserves its right to issue separate notices.
Contractor acknowledges that CBBC is not obligated to proceed with any of the New
Segments. If CBBC elects not to proceed with a New Segment, Contractor will provide
Contractor with a notice of cancellation and Contractor will not be entitled to any
compensation for lost profits; however, CBBC will compensate Contractor for mutually
agreed upon out\-of\-pocket expenses (i.e., pre\-purchased material) reasonably
incurred up until the date of the notice of cancelation of the New Segment.

4\. SCOPE OF WORK
The Contractor will perform the work described in or inferred by this Agreement,
including Schedule A (CBBC’s Specifications), all in accordance with all terms and
conditions of this Agreement.
5\. CONSTRUCTION OF NEW SEGMENTS
5\.1\. CBBC’s Specifications and CBBC’s Designs
Contractor will review CBBC’s Specifications and CBBC’s Design for each of the New
Segments and promptly report any alleged material errors, inconsistencies or
omissions. Without limiting CBBC’s rights under Section 8\.2, Contractor and CBBC
may refine and amend CBBC’s Specifications and/or CBBC’s Designs by mutual
agreement to correct any such errors that CBBC, in its sole discretion, determines to
exist. Contractor will price the proposed Changes to correct such errors as a cost
increase or cost saving, as the case may be, and will determine the additional or
reduced time, if any, to effect such Changes. CBBC may elect to proceed with such
proposed Changes if they do not result in an increase in the Fee or, if a Change Order
authorizing a corresponding Fee increase is issued by CBBC pursuant to an
agreement to that effect between CBBC and Contractor.
5\.2\. Construction
Upon receiving the Notice to Proceed, Contractor will commence Construction of a
New Segment in accordance with the applicable Timetable for the New Segment.
CBBC will act reasonably in determining when to issue a Notice to Proceed and will
consider seasonal conditions before issuing the Notice to Proceed. Contractor will
complete the Construction of each New Segment so that it is complete, fully functional
and fit for its intended purpose and will complete the Construction in accordance with:
(a) CBBC’s Specifications;
(b) CBBC’s Design for the relevant New Segment;
(c) The terms of this Agreement;
(d) Good Industry Practice; and
(e) Applicable Laws.
5\.3\. Liens
Contractor will always ensure that no Liens exist and will take all steps required to
cause the discharge, removal or withdrawal of any Liens in accordance with this
Agreement.
In the event that any Claim of Lien is filed in respect of any Work by anyone engaged
by or under Contractor, Contractor shall, within ten (10\) days, at its sole expense,
remove or obtain a cancellation of such Claim of Lien. In the event that any Holdback
Lien exists, Contractor shall, upon CBBC making written demand to do so, diligently
take all reasonable steps to settle, expedite the resolution of, or negotiate, a consent
dismissal or withdrawal of, any such Holdback Lien.
If Contractor fails or refuses to remove or obtain a cancellation of any Claim of Lien
within the time prescribed above, CBBC shall, at its option, be entitled to take all steps
32

necessary to remove or, obtain a cancellation of the Claim of Lien, and all costs and
expenses incurred by CBBC in so doing (including actual legal fees and any payment
which may ultimately be made out of or pursuant to money paid to remove or obtain
a cancellation of the Claim of Lien) shall be for the account of Contractor, and shall
be paid by Contractor to CBBC forthwith upon demand.
Prior to the satisfaction, dismissal or withdrawal of any Holdback Lien, within ten (10\)
days of Contractor’s receipt of CBBC’s written demand, Contractor shall remain in
compliance with the requirements of this provision by providing CBBC with a letter of
credit or other security on terms acceptable to CBBC, for an amount equal to the
monetary amount claimed by the claimant under the Holdback Lien (up to a maximum
aggregate amount of security, for all such Holdback Liens of ten percent (10%) of the
Fee), or such other equal or lower amount as may be acceptable to CBBC, such letter
of credit or other security to be available to protect CBBC from any costs, losses or
damages in any way related to such Holdback Lien until the Holdback Lien is satisfied,
dismissed or withdrawn in all respects against CBBC, and Contractor shall continue
diligently to take all reasonable steps to settle, expedite the resolution of, or negotiate
a consent dismissal of or withdrawal of any such Holdback Lien.
CBBC will withhold from each payment an amount equal to the Holdback, which
amount will be deposited in the Holdback account established in accordance with the
Builders Lien Act, S.B.C. 1997, c.45\. The Holdback shall be paid to Contractor fifty\-
six (56\) days after issuance of the Certificate of Completion in respect of this
Agreement, provided that no Claim of Lien then exists relating to the Work and no
Holdback Lien exists. Contractor shall provide CBBC with satisfactory evidence of
the removal, cancellation or withdrawal of any such Claim of Lien or Holdback Lien,
as applicable, as of the date of the release of the Holdback.
5\.4\. Lien Indemnity
Without limiting any of the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
Contractor shall indemnify and save the CBBC Indemnified Persons harmless from
and against any claims, costs, losses and damages the CBBC Indemnified Persons
may incur in connection with any Lien.

The Contractor may Subcontract the Work to the Subcontractors listed in Schedule G
(Subcontractors). The Contractor will not, without CBBC’s prior written approval (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld), Subcontract any of the Work to any other
subcontractor.
The use of a Subcontractor to perform the Work shall not relieve Contractor of the
responsibility for the full performance of its obligations under the Agreement and
Contractor agrees that, as between CBBC and Contractor, Contractor shall be solely
responsible for:
(a) Managing and communicating with the Subcontractors and enforcing all
material provisions of the Subcontracts; and

In addition to the above requirements and on a quarterly basis, the Contractor will
provide CBBC with a statutory declaration in the form of the Canadian Construction
Documents Committee CCDC\-9A\-2001 and a WorkSafe BC clearance letter.
The amount claimed shall be for the value, proportionate to the amount of the Fee, of
Work performed and material incorporated into the Work as of the last day of the
payment period as determined in the fee schedule.
The Contractor may:
(a) invoice for up to 50% of the optical fibre that is ordered associated with the
Work; and
(b) subsequently invoice for the balance of payment for such fibre upon the
Contractor’s receipt of the fibre. The Contractor must provide evidence of
ordering and receipt of such fibre to CBBC for CBBC’s approval, prior to the
Contractor receiving payment for the fibre from CBBC.
36

It is a condition precedent to payment that CBBC receives an invoice containing all
the information set out in this paragraph.
Contractor shall provide CBBC, at CBBC’s request, such documents and particulars
relating to GST, PST or any other amount that are necessary to substantiate any claim
by CBBC for any input tax credits or refund or other credit as may be permitted
pursuant to any applicable Laws.
Upon request, Contractor will promptly provide CBBC with a detailed schedule of
values, and associated documentation, that includes a detailed breakdown of the Fee.
Such documentation requested by CBBC may include but not be limited to:
• Subcontractor or third party invoices or charges; and
• paystubs for Contractor’s workers.
If the schedule of values is acceptable to CBBC, it will be used solely for the purpose
of assisting the Payment Certifier assess the progress of the Work for payment
applications.
7\.3\. Payment
Provided that no Liens then exist, CBBC shall pay Contractor all undisputed amounts,
minus any applicable Holdbacks and set offs in accordance with Section 7\.4, within
30 days of receipt of the invoice from Contractor. If CBBC determines that any portion
of an invoice is not payable, CBBC will so advise Contractor within fifteen (15\) days
of receipt of the invoice and CBBC will pay the portion of the invoice which CBBC
determines is payable within thirty (30\) days of the receipt of the invoice.
If necessary, the Parties may refer a Dispute under this Section 7\.3 to the Dispute
Resolution Procedure in Section 22, but Contractor shall proceed with any additional
Work required under this Agreement without interruption pending the resolution of any
such Dispute.
7\.4\. Holdbacks and Set Off
CBBC shall retain from each payment to Contractor all required Holdbacks and shall
set off from each payment any amounts owing by Contractor to CBBC in connection
with this Agreement. All Holdbacks shall be released to Contractor in accordance with
the Builders Lien Act, S.B.C. 1997, c.45\. If Contractor owes any monies to CBBC for
any reason whatsoever, without prejudice to any other right or remedy that CBBC may
have, CBBC may deduct, offset and set off such amount from any payments owing to
Contractor under this Agreement.
8\. CHANGES
8\.1\. Contractor’s Changes to CBBC’s Designs
Contractor will not make any material changes to CBBC’s Design for the New
Segments without the prior written consent of CBBC. The Contractor may substitute
materials that meet CBBC’s Specifications with CBBC’s consent which may not be
reasonably withheld. Contractor will provide CBBC with prompt written notice of all
such substitutions. If Contractor wishes to substitute products or materials with
37

products or materials having performance standards that are not equivalent to those
of the replaced products or materials, Contractor must obtain CBBC’s approval by
submitting a Change Order request using the Project Change Order Request
Template attached to this Agreement in Schedule K. The Contractor acknowledges
that no substitute materials will be purchased prior to CBBC’s approval of a Change
Order.
8\.2\. Change Orders
CBBC and Contractor may at any time during the Term, without invalidating this
Agreement, agree to a Change by executing a Change Order in accordance with
Section 8\.3\. Except to the extent that a Change Order requires otherwise, the Parties
will implement all Changes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
The following process will be used for Changes:
(a) Where a Change is proposed or required by CBBC, Contractor will promptly,
and in any case within ten (10\) days after the Change is proposed or required
by CBBC, present to CBBC its claims for any adjustment to the Fee or the time
schedule that arises from the Change.
(b) Where Contractor claims a Change in Fee, Contractor will provide a full
breakdown of labour, material and other cost information reasonably requested
by CBBC associated with the Fees.
(c) Where CBBC and Contractor agree to the Change, including adjustments in
the Fee and time schedule, or to the method to be used to determine the
adjustments, such Change will be effective when recorded in a Change Order.
(d) If a Change increases costs for the Work, the Contractor’s profits and
administrative Fees, related to that Change Order, shall not collectively exceed
10% of the total cost of the Work associated with the Change Order. This
includes, but is not limited to, any labor, materials, equipment, subcontracting,
and services necessary for the execution of the Change Order.
(e) If a Change results in a cost savings, up to 10% of the savings in Fees may be
shared with the Contractor at CBBC’s sole discretion. For clarity, CBBC may
choose to share up to 10% of any savings in Fees with the Contractor, resulting
from a Change Order. CBBC’s considerations for sharing savings relating to a
Change Order may include but are not limited to:
i. any long\-term obligations created;
ii. the impact on any other of CBBC’s projects, operation, or infrastructure;
iii. the expected profit margins of the Contractor; and
iv. the overall budget and/or forecast of the Fees to complete the Work, and
if those Fees are within CBBC’s expectations.
(f) If the methods of valuation, measurement and value of any Change or any
adjustment to the Fees cannot be promptly agreed upon, and in any case within
38

ten (10\) days after the proposed Change, then the Change will be performed
by Contractor and the value of the Change and adjustment to the time schedule
will be determined in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure.
8\.3\. Implementation of Change
Where Schedule B (Fees and Timetable) includes hourly rates or unit rates that are
applicable to the activities required for a Change, the Parties will use such pricing. A
Change will come into effect when a Change Order, in the form of Schedule K, is
agreed between CBBC and Contractor and signed by an authorized signatory of each
Party. A Change Order that has come into effect in accordance with this Section 8\.3
will be binding upon CBBC and Contractor, and Contractor will implement the agreed
upon Change in accordance with the Change Order. For greater certainty, Contractor
will not proceed with a Change unless the Change Order has come into effect in
accordance with this Section 8\.3\. The Contractor acknowledges that CBBC reserves
the right to accept or deny the proposed Change and the cost of any Work performed
by the Contractor prior to acceptance of the proposed Change Order, should the
Change Order be denied, will not be the responsibility of CBBC. CBBC and the
Contractor acknowledge that an appropriate response time of no more than five (5\)
Business Days will be observed for all Change Orders submitted by either Party.
8\.4\. Materials and Supplies
If CBBC, at its sole discretion and acting in good faith, determines that the Contractor’s
proposed lead times for sourcing the material and supplies required to construct the
New Segments will delay project completion, CBBC reserves the right to source all or
some of the required materials and supplies necessary to construct the New
Segments directly through a third party. If CBBC elects to exercise its rights under this
Section 8\.4, CBBC will issue a Change Order following the process outlined in Section
8\.2 and CBBC and the Contractor will work to determine the reduction in the Fee due
to CBBC absolving the Contractor of its obligation to purchase such materials and
supplies necessary to construct the New Segments as described in Section 6\.1\.
9\. SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE WORK AND CERTIFICATE OF
COMPLETION
9\.1\. Acceptance Testing
Contractor will conduct a final test of all New Segments in their entirety and provide a
report to CBBC setting out the test results. Contractor will conduct the acceptance
testing (Acceptance Testing) in accordance with Good Industry Practice and the
procedures and standards specified in Schedule D and will confirm that this is the
case in the test results report. CBBC’s Project Manager may, at CBBC's cost, attend
and observe the Acceptance Testing.
9\.2\. CBBC’s Testing
Without limiting Contractor’s obligations in Section 9\.1, CBBC may, as New Segments
are completed, connect its network equipment to the completed New Segment and
39

conduct network and equipment testing as CBBC deems necessary, acting
reasonably. Contractor will grant to CBBC, and its employees and representatives,
reasonable access to New Segments in order for CBBC to complete such testing and
will, at the same time, provide all applicable as\-built reports. If CBBC requires any
right, permit or license from any third party to access and test any portion of the New
Segments, Contractor will use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such right,
permit or license for CBBC’s use and benefit.
9\.3\. Application for Certificate of Substantial Performance
When the Contractor believes it has achieved Substantial Performance of the Work
and completed the Acceptance Testing, the Contractor will make a written application
for a certificate of Substantial Performance of the Work, supported by a certificate
from the Contractor that the Work completed to date has been completed in
accordance with CBBC’s Specifications. Contractor will include a copy of the
Acceptance Testing and as\-built reports (if Contractor has not previously delivered
such reports) with the application.
9\.4\. CBBC’s Inspection for Substantial Performance of the Work
The CBBC Representative will, not later than ten days, unless an alternate timeline is
agreed to by both Parties, after the receipt of an application from the Contractor for a
certificate of Substantial Performance of the Work, make an inspection and
assessment of the Work to verify the validity of the application.
The CBBC Representative will, not later than seven days, unless an alternate timeline
is agreed to by both Parties, after completing the inspection, notify the Contractor of
approval, or the reasons for disapproval, of the application. The Parties will apply the
foregoing procedure as many times as CBBC determines, in its sole discretion to be
reasonable, until either Contractor has remedied all defects or failures specified by
CBBC’s Project Manager or until CBBC, in its sole discretion, determines that
Contractor is unable or unwilling to remedy any remaining defects or failures, which
CBBC may then treat as Contractor Event of Default.
If the CBBC Representative finds that Substantial Performance of the Work has been
reached, the CBBC Representative will issue a written notice of Substantial
Performance of the Work. The date of Substantial Performance of the Work will be as
stated in the written notice of Substantial Performance. Notwithstanding the issuance
of a written notice of Substantial Performance, the Contractor will proceed diligently
to obtain a Certificate of Completion.
9\.5\. Waiver Upon Application for Substantial Performance of the Work
The Contractor’s application for Substantial Performance of the Work will constitute
a waiver of all claims up until the date of the application other than those claims
previously submitted to CBBC in writing.
9\.6\. Contractor’s Application for Certificate of Completion
For the purposes of this Agreement, an Application for a Certificate of Completion
means that every aspect of the Work has been performed and completed in
accordance with this Agreement and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
40

(a) all items identified in the comprehensive deficiency list have been rectified or
completed to CBBC’s satisfaction;
(b) the Work meets all warranty requirements and the warranties described in
Agreement are in place; and
(c) copies of any documents related to the Work, including guarantees, warranties,
instructions, plans and as\-built drawings, have been delivered to CBBC.
When the Contractor has determined that the requirements for Builders Lien Act have
been met regarding contract completion, the Contractor will apply in writing to the
CBBC Representative, in a form acceptable to the CBBC Representative, for a
Certificate of Completion and will include with such application its request for final
payment and any details, documents and assurances the CBBC Representative may
reasonably require.
When the CBBC Representative is satisfied that contract completion has been
attained, it will issue the Certificate of Completion and CBBC will pay the remaining
balance of the Agreement price to the Contractor after a period of 55 days (see section
5\.3, Holdback Liens).
9\.7\. Waiver Upon Application for Certificate of Completion
The Contractor’s application for a Certificate of Completion will constitute a waiver of
all claims related to the Work or this Agreement other than those claims previously
submitted to CBBC in writing. The issuance of a Certificate of Substantial
Performance or a Certificate of Completion does not relieve the Contractor from
correcting any defects and deficiencies discovered thereafter.
10\. INSPECTIONS AND WARRANTIES
10\.1\. Inspections
CBBC may, at its cost on at least twenty\-four (24\) hours prior written notice to
Contractor, inspect the New Segment(s), including the installation, splicing and testing
of the New Segment(s), provided that any such inspection will be for CBBC's benefit
only, and no such inspection will in any way relieve Contractor of its obligation for all
aspects of the Construction and Acceptance Testing of the New Segment(s).
Contractor will permit CBBC and any of CBBC’s authorized representatives
reasonable access to the New Segment(s) and to any documents related to the New
Segments in the possession or control of Contractor. If CBBC requires any right,
permit or license from any third party to access and inspect any portion of the New
Segment(s), Contractor will use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain such right,
permit or license for CBBC’s use and benefit.
Contractor will provide any Government Authority with reasonable access to any work
site including the location of the work, for the purpose of ensuring that the terms and
conditions of any approval (where applicable) are met, and that any mitigation,
monitoring or follow\-up measure required has been carried out.
10\.2\. Warranties
41

Contractor warrants that each New Segment and related work will meet CBBC’s
Design and CBBC’s Specifications and be of the quality specified, free from defects
in workmanship and materials and suitable for the purposes contemplated by this
Agreement for a period of one (1\) year from the Acceptance Date of the New Segment
and all related work.
As part of the Construction, Contractor will, for a period of one (1\) year after the
Acceptance Completion Date of a New Segment and related work, make all repairs,
maintenance, replacements or alterations within or upon the New Segment and all
related work required as a result of material non\-compliance with CBBC’s Design or
CBBC’s Specifications for the New Segment or all related work, or as a result of
defects in the workmanship or materials provided to or incorporated therein.
Effective as of the Acceptance Date of a New Segment and all related work,
Contractor will assign to CBBC all service guarantees and warranties relating to the
New Segment and all of its constituent components and labour, but such assignment
will not relieve Contractor from its obligations under this Section 10\.2, provided that
CBBC will authorize Contractor to pursue third party warranties on behalf of CBBC.
11\. RECORD KEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Contractor will maintain to the reasonable satisfaction of CBBC, all records relating to
invoices provided to CBBC and payments made to Contractor by CBBC pursuant to
this Agreement and all relevant supporting documentation, including but not limited to
paystubs, timesheets, invoices, work descriptions, invoices (including Subcontractor
invoices), material and labour costs, receipts, and notes, and Contractor will make
such records available for review by CBBC or CBBC’s authorized representatives on
a consistent and ongoing basis during normal business hours. Contractor will take all
steps reasonably required by CBBC to ensure CBBC or its authorized representatives
remain informed about the progress of the Construction and the Acceptance Testing,
including without limitation preparing and delivering to CBBC a monthly report on all
material aspects of the Construction and the Acceptance Testing, including:
(a) The approved Timetable, with anticipated and actual variations together with
reasons for such variations; and
(b) The percent Construction complete of each New Segment and the Acceptance
Testing of the New Segment then under Construction or subject to Acceptance
Testing.
The Contractor will comply with CBBC’s reporting requirements and provide CBBC
with a summary each billing cycle in the form of Schedule J to the Agreement outlining
all labor, equipment and materials progressed.
The Contractor acknowledges that any Government Authority may conduct periodic
audits of the Contractor’s records related to this Agreement, including without
restrictions financial records. The Contractor will, at its own expense, preserve and
make available for audit and examination by any Government Authority all books,
accounts and records of the project, the Contractor’s administrative, financial and
42

claim processes and procedures, and any other information deemed necessary by
the Government Authority pursuant to CBBC’s obligations.
12\. TIMETABLE
12\.1\. Substantial Performance Deadline
The Contractor will attain Substantial Performance of the Work by no later than \[DAY]
\[MONTH], \[YEAR] (the “Substantial Performance Deadline”).
12\.2\. Extension of Substantial Performance Deadline
The Contractor will be entitled to an adjustment to the time schedule and an extension
of the Substantial Performance Deadline if the Contractor’s performance of the Work
is delayed by an unforeseeable event or circumstance which is beyond the
Contractor’s reasonable control and if the Contractor has taken all reasonable steps
in the circumstances to avoid or minimize the delay. If such an event or circumstance
occurs, CBBC and the Contractor, each acting reasonably, will agree on any
necessary changes to the time schedule and the Substantial Performance Deadline.
No extension will be made unless the Contractor provides to CBBC notice of the delay
within five days of the commencement of the delay describing the event causing the
delay and the steps the Contractor is taking to minimize the delay.
12\.3\. Timetable
Contractor shall, at all times, ensure that it is representing its work schedule in an
accurate, reasonable and realistic manner, in all material respects, including
Contractor’s expected schedule for the completion of the Construction and the
Acceptance Testing for each New Segment in accordance with this Agreement.
Contractor will, as required from time to time until the Acceptance Date for a New
Segment and all related work, but no less than once per calendar month, deliver to
CBBC’s Project Manager an updated schedule for review for compliance with the
requirements of this Agreement, which updated schedule will include the following:
(a) Adjustments resulting from delays and Change Orders, if any, as permitted by
this Agreement;
(b) As the design of each New Segment progresses, best estimates of:
i. The planned start and completion dates of the major activities of the
Construction;
ii. The estimated Substantial Performance of the Work date; and
iii. The estimated Acceptance Date.
To the extent confirmed and approved by CBBC’s Project Manager in writing, the
Timetable (found in Schedule B \- Fees and Timetable) will be updated by CBBC to
reflect Contractor’s schedule updates. If at any time either Contractor’s or CBBC’s
Project Manager, as the case may be, does not agree with any proposed updates to
the Timetable, the disagreement will be resolved pursuant to Section 22\.
12\.4\. Compliance with Timetable
43

Contractor will undertake the Construction and the Acceptance Testing in compliance
with the Timetable, as updated pursuant to this Agreement.
12\.5\. Delay
Contractor will promptly notify CBBC in writing if the Construction lags the schedule
set out in the Timetable or upon becoming aware of any actual or threatened
occurrence or condition which would reasonably be expected to cause a delay in
meeting any deadline in the Timetable.
In the event of a delay other than a delay due to a Change Order, Contractor will use
all reasonable commercial efforts to overcome or minimize the effects of such delay
(including rearranging and rescheduling the Construction so as to minimize the
ultimate delay in completion of the relevant Construction and Acceptance Testing),
utilizing to such end all resources reasonably required in the circumstances, including
obtaining supplies or services from other sources if the same are reasonably
available, provided that, in the event of Unavoidable Delay or a delay caused by any
act or omission of CBBC inconsistent with its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (a “CBBC Delay Event”), Contractor will advise CBBC of any additional
costs required to overcome or minimize the effects of such delay and Contractor will
not be required to incur such additional costs unless CBBC has agreed to reimburse
Contractor for such costs.
If Contractor does not achieve Substantial Performance of the Work for a New

SCHEDULE D \- ACCEPTANCE TESTING
Acceptance Testing will include the following steps:
(a) All fibre optic strands will be pre\-tested with an Optical Time Domain Reflectometer
(OTDR) to verify integrity. Test results should be provided to the CBBC Project
Manager.
(b) After end\-to\-end connectivity on the fibres has been completed, bi\-directional
OTDR span and power meter testing will be completed. Testing is to occur after
the fibre cable is installed and the splicing enclosures have been completed. This
ensures that no micro or macro bending problems with the cable or fibre strands
will contribute to the loss/attenuation measurements.
(c) Power meter tests will be completed to verify and ensure that no fibres have been
crossed at any of the splice points within the network. Contractor will test and
record power level readings on all fibre strands in both directions of transmission
(bi\-directionally) using the 1310 and 1550 nm wavelengths.
(d) All OTDR and power meter tests will be completed as follows:
1\. All OTDR traces will be taken from both ends of a segment and recorded
using the 1310 \& 1550 nm wavelength. Loss/attenuation measurements for
each splice point from both directions will be taken and recorded.
2\. The end\-to\-end loss value as measured with an industry\-accepted laser
source and power meter should have an attenuation rating of less than or
equal to the following:
i. At 1310 nm: (0\.40 dB/km x km of cable) \+ (number of connectors x 0\.50\)
\+ (0\.10 x number of splices); and
ii. At 1550 nm: (0\.30 dB/km x km of cable) \+ (number of connectors x 0\.50\)
\+ (0\.10 x number of splices).
3\. Each fibre strand colour must be recorded along with its buffer tube colour
or the ribbon colour. The laser source transmit power level using the 1310
and 1550 nm wavelengths will always be recorded together with the receive
power level reading at the receiving end of the test.
4\. Copies of all data sheets and tables and one set of CDs or USD storage
drives with all traces will be available to CBBC.
5\. A summary of all tests will also be supplied in the format requested in
Schedule H (Quality Control Checklist \& OTDR Summary Form).
6\. Following emergency restoral, Contractor personnel will perform span test
documenting end\-to\-end attenuation measurement of each fibre and will be
completed in both directions at 1310 \& 1550 nm wavelengths. Upon
permanent repair, new splice loss readings should be no greater than the
original splice loss specifications.
(e) Contractor will take reasonable care to prevent impairment to the signal continuity
and performance of the CBBC fibres.

SCHEDULE I \- PRIVACY PROTECTION
In this Schedule CBBC is called “Public Body”
Definitions
1\. In this Schedule,
(a) "access" means disclosure by the provision of access;
(b) "Act" means the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (British Columbia), as
amended from time to time;
(c) "contact information" means information to enable an individual at a place of business to be
contacted and includes the name, position name or title, business telephone number, business
address, business email or business fax number of the individual; and
(d) "personal information" means recorded information about an identifiable individual, other
than contact information, collected or created by the Contractor as a result of the Agreement
or any previous agreement between the Public Body and the Contractor dealing with the same
subject matter as the Agreement but excluding any such information that, if this Schedule did
not apply to it, would not be under the “control of a public body” within the meaning of the Act.
Purpose
2\. The purpose of this Schedule is to:
(a) enable the Public Body to comply with its statutory obligations under the Act with respect to
personal information; and
(b) ensure that, as a service provider, the Contractor is aware of and complies with its statutory
obligations under the Act with respect to personal information.
Collection of personal information
3\. Unless the Agreement otherwise specifies or the Public Body otherwise directs in writing, the
Contractor may only collect or create personal information that is necessary for the performance
of the Contractor’s obligations, or the exercise of the Contractor’s rights, under the Agreement.
4\. Unless the Agreement otherwise specifies or the Public Body otherwise directs in writing, the
Contractor must collect personal information directly from the individual the information is about.
5\. Unless the Agreement otherwise specifies or the Public Body otherwise directs in writing, the
Contractor must tell an individual from whom the Contractor collects personal information:
(a) the purpose for collecting it;
(b) the legal authority for collecting it; and
(c) the title, business address and business telephone number of the person designated by the
Public Body to answer questions about the Contractor’s collection of personal information.
Accuracy of personal information
6\. The Contractor must make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy and completeness of
any personal information to be used by the Contractor or the Public Body to make a decision that
directly affects the individual the information is about.
76

Requests for access to personal information
7\. If the Contractor receives a request for access to personal information from a person other than
the Public Body, the Contractor must promptly advise the person to make the request to the Public
Body unless the Agreement expressly requires the Contractor to provide such access and, if the
Public Body has advised the Contractor of the name or title and contact information of an official
of the Public Body to whom such requests are to be made, the Contractor must also promptly
provide that official’s name or title and contact information to the person making the request.
Correction of personal information
8\. Within five (5\) Business Days of receiving a written direction from the Public Body to correct or
annotate any personal information, the Contractor must annotate or correct the information in
accordance with the direction.
9\. When issuing a written direction under section 8, the Public Body must advise the Contractor of
the date the correction request to which the direction relates was received by the Public Body in
order that the Contractor may comply with section 10\.
10\. Within five (5\) Business Days of correcting or annotating any personal information under section
8, the Contractor must provide the corrected or annotated information to any party to whom, within
one year prior to the date the correction request was made to the Public Body, the Contractor
disclosed the information being corrected or annotated.
11\. If the Contractor receives a request for correction of personal information from a person other than
the Public Body, the Contractor must promptly advise the person to make the request to the Public
Body and, if the Public Body has advised the Contractor of the name or title and contact information
of an official of the Public Body to whom such requests are to be made, the Contractor must also
promptly provide that official’s name or title and contact information to the person making the
request.
Protection of personal information
12\. The Contractor must protect personal information by making reasonable security arrangements
against such risks as unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, or disposal, including any
expressly set out in the Agreement.
Storage and access to personal information
13\. Unless the Public Body otherwise directs in writing, the Contractor must not store personal
information outside Canada or permit access to personal information from outside Canada.
Retention of personal information
14\. Unless the Agreement otherwise specifies, the Contractor must retain personal information until
directed by the Public Body in writing to dispose of it or deliver it as specified in the direction.
Use of personal information
15\. Unless the Public Body otherwise directs in writing, the Contractor may only use personal
information if that use is for the performance of the Contractor’s obligations, or the exercise of the
Contractor’s rights, under the Agreement.
77

Disclosure of personal information
16\. Unless the Public Body otherwise directs in writing, the Contractor may only disclose personal
information inside Canada to any person other than the Public Body if the disclosure is for the
performance of the Contractor’s obligations, or the exercise of the Contractor’s rights, under the
Agreement.
17\. Unless the Agreement otherwise specifies or the Public Body otherwise directs in writing, the
Contractor must not disclose personal information outside Canada.
Notice of foreign demands for disclosure
18\. In addition to any obligation the Contractor may have to provide the notification contemplated by
section 30\.2 of the Act, if in relation to personal information in its custody or under its control the
Contractor:
(a) receives a foreign demand for disclosure;
(b) receives a request to disclose, produce or provide access that the Contractor knows or has
reason to suspect is for the purpose of responding to a foreign demand for disclosure; or
(c) has reason to suspect that an unauthorized disclosure of personal information has occurred in
response to a foreign demand for disclosure.
The Contractor must immediately notify the Public Body and, in so doing, provide the information
described in section 30\.2(3\) of the Act. In this section, the phrases "foreign demand for disclosure"
and "unauthorized disclosure of personal information" will bear the same meanings as in section
30\.2 of the Act.
Notice of unauthorized disclosure
19\. In addition to any obligation the Contractor may have to provide the notification contemplated by
section 30\.5 of the Act, if the Contractor knows that there has been an unauthorized disclosure of
personal information in its custody or under its control, the Contractor must immediately notify the
Public Body. In this section, the phrase "unauthorized disclosure of personal information" will bear
the same meaning as in section 30\.5 of the Act.
Inspection of personal information
20\. In addition to any other rights of inspection the Public Body may have under the Agreement or
under statute, the Public Body may, at any reasonable time and on reasonable notice to the
Contractor, enter on the Contractor’s premises to inspect any personal information in the
possession of the Contractor or any of the Contractor’s information management policies or
practices relevant to its management of personal information or its compliance with this Schedule
and the Contractor must permit, and provide reasonable assistance to, any such inspection.
Compliance with the Act and directions
21\. The Contractor must in relation to personal information comply with:

proposes to take to address, or prevent recurrence of, the non\-compliance or anticipated non\-
compliance.
Termination of Agreement
24\. In addition to any other rights of termination which the Public Body may have under the Agreement
or otherwise at law, the Public Body may, subject to any provisions in the Agreement establishing
mandatory cure periods for defaults by the Contractor, terminate the Agreement by giving written
notice of such termination to the Contractor, upon any failure of the Contractor to comply with this
Schedule in a material respect.
Interpretation
25\. In this Schedule, references to sections by number are to sections of this Schedule unless
otherwise specified in this Schedule.

the Contractor to perform obligations under the Agreement and the Contractor must ensure that
any such subcontractors and agents comply with this Schedule.
27\. The obligations of the Contractor in this Schedule will survive the termination of the Agreement.
28\. If a provision of the Agreement (including any direction given by the Public Body under this
Schedule) conflicts with a requirement of the Act or an applicable order of the commissioner under
the Act, the conflicting provision of the Agreement (or direction) will be inoperative to the extent of
the conflict.
29\. The Contractor must comply with the provisions of this Schedule despite any conflicting provision
of this Agreement or, subject to section 30, the law of any jurisdiction outside Canada.
30\. Nothing in this Schedule requires the Contractor to contravene the law of any jurisdiction outside
