The Health Organization wishes to retain the Contractor to provide the services specified in Schedule A and, in
consideration for the remuneration set out in Schedule B, the Contractor has agreed to provide those services, on the
terms and conditions set out in this Agreement.
As a result, the Health Organization and the Contractor agree as follows:
1 DEFINITIONS
General
1\.1 In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires:
(a) “Business Day” means a day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which Provincial government
offices are open for normal business in British Columbia;
(b) “Incorporated Material” means any material in existence prior to the start of the Term or developed
independently of this Agreement, and that is incorporated or embedded in the Produced Material
by the Contractor or a Subcontractor;
(c) “Material” means the Produced Material and the Received Material;
(d) “Produced Material” means records, software and other material, whether complete or not, that, as
a result of this Agreement, are produced or provided by the Contractor or a Subcontractor and
includes the Incorporated Material;
(e) “Received Material” means records, software and other material, whether complete or not, that, as
a result of this Agreement, are received by the Contractor or a Subcontractor from the Health
Organization or any other person;
(f) “Services” means the services described in Part 2 of Schedule A;
(g) “Subcontractor” means a person described in paragraph (a) or (b) of section 13\.4; and
(h) “Term” means the term of the Agreement described in Part 1 of Schedule A subject to that term
ending earlier in accordance with this Agreement.
Meaning of “record”
1\.2 The definition of “record” in the Interpretation Act is incorporated into this Agreement and “records” will
bear a corresponding meaning.
2 SERVICES
Provision of services
1

2\.1 The Contractor must provide the Services in accordance with this Agreement.
Term
2\.2 Regardless of the date of execution or delivery of this Agreement, the Contractor must provide the Services
during the Term.
Supply of various items
2\.3 Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, the Contractor must supply and pay for all labour, materials,
equipment, tools, facilities, approvals and licenses necessary or advisable to perform the Contractor’s
obligations under this Agreement, including the license under section 6\.4\.
Standard of care
2\.4 Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, the Contractor must perform the Services to a standard of
care, skill and diligence maintained by persons providing, on a commercial basis, services similar to the
Services.
Standards in relation to persons performing Services
2\.5 The Contractor must ensure that all persons employed or retained to perform the Services are qualified
and competent to perform them and are properly trained, instructed and supervised.
Instructions by Health Organization
2\.6 The Health Organization may from time to time give the Contractor reasonable instructions (in writing or
otherwise) as to the performance of the Services. The Contractor must comply with those instructions but,
unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, the Contractor may determine the manner in which the
instructions are carried out.
Confirmation of non\-written instructions
2\.7 If the Health Organization provides an instruction under section 2\.6 other than in writing, the Contractor
may request that the instruction be confirmed by the Health Organization in writing, which request the
Health Organization must comply with as soon as it is reasonably practicable to do so.

2\.8 Requesting written confirmation of an instruction under section 2\.7 does not relieve the Contractor from
complying with the instruction at the time the instruction was given.

2\.9 In the performance of the Contractor’s obligations under this Agreement, the Contractor must comply with
all applicable laws.
3 PAYMENT
Fees and expenses

taxation authorities on the fees and expenses described in paragraphs (a) and (b).

connection with the provision of the Services. An amount withheld under this section must be promptly
paid by the Health Organization to the Contractor upon the basis for withholding the amount having been
fully resolved to the satisfaction of the Health Organization.
Appropriation
3\.4 The Health Organization’s obligation to pay money to the Contractor is subject to the Financial
Administration Act, which makes that obligation subject to an appropriation being available in the fiscal
year of the Health Organization during which payment becomes due.
Currency
3\.5 Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, all references to money are to Canadian dollars.
Non\-resident income tax
3\.6 If the Contractor is not a resident in Canada, the Contractor acknowledges that the Health Organization
may be required by law to withhold income tax from the fees described in Schedule B and then to remit
that tax to the Receiver General of Canada on the Contractor’s behalf.
Prohibition against committing money

obligations under this Agreement commit or purport to commit the Health Organization to pay any money

3

(b) immediately on receiving, or being credited with, any amount applied for under paragraph (a), remit
